# AKAN NAMES

### Author: Walter Siameto
          I'm walter siameto the author of this project

## DESCRIPTION
          This application will require users to enter their birthdays using the forms on the webpage and select their gender. Using this input, the application will then calculate the specific day on which they were born and return their Akan name according to their day of birth. All this is based on the Ghanian culture of naming according to gender and the day on which the baby was born.

## SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
          Once the user opens the repository using the link provided, they will see a link to another webpage in the 'about' section of the repository. Upon clicking this link, they will be directed to the webpage containing the forms on which the they will enter the information required to receive the required output.

## BEHAVIOUR DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT
         During the development stages of this application, I as the developer had an idea of what the application would do upon completion of its development. This allowed me to break down its development into smaller sub-program which were then finally merged to create the application.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED
         The technologies used in the development were: Hypertext Markup Language, Cascading Style Sheets and Javascript.
